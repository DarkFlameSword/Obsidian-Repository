# Rationality Depends on PEAS
### e.g: Internet shopping agent:

Performance measure

- cheap, good quality, appropriate product

Environment

- current internet sites, vendors

Actuators

- Packages that display to user, follow URL, fill in forms

Sensors

- Packages that read HTML pages (text, graphics,

scripts)

## Environment Types
**Fully Observable / Partially Observable**
- An agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at all times
**Known / Unknown**
- An agent knows the “laws” of the environment 
**Single Agent / Multi Agent**
- An agent operating by itself in an environment
**Deterministic / Stochastic**
- The next state is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent
**Episodic (sequential)**
- The agent's experience is divided into atomic episodes. The next episode does NOT depend on previous actions
**Static (dynamic)**
- The environment is unchanged while an agent is deliberating
**Discrete (continuous)**
- Pertains to number of states, the way time is handled, and number of percepts and actions

==Tips:==
1. - **目标导向型 (Goal-Based):** 只关心“**能不能达成目标**”，结果是二元的（成功/失败）。
2. **效用导向型 (Utility-Based):** 关心“**达成目标的程度有多好**”，结果是连续的（有一个“幸福度”或“满意度”分数）。
